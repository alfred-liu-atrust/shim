  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Fix Vcs link.

  [ dann frazier ]
  * Enable arm64 build.

  [ Mathieu Trudel-Lapierre ]
  * New upstream snapshot.
  * debian/patches/abort_abort_abort.patch: dropped patch, included upstream.
  * debian/rules:
    - define RELEASE and COMMIT_ID for the snapshot.
    - Set ENABLE_HTTPBOOT to enable the HTTP Boot feature.
  * debian/patches/fixup_git.patch: don't run git in clean; we're not really
    in a git tree.

shim (13-0ubuntu2) bionic; urgency=medium

  * debian/patches/abort_abort_abort.patch: signtool.exe isn't happy with some
    of the structure of our binary, partly because abort() is thought to be an
    external symbol, which causes some relocalisations to appear.

shim (13-0ubuntu1) artful; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release: 13
  * debian/control: add a Build-Depends on libelf-dev.
  * debian/control: add Breaks: for the previous shim-signed builds given
    that shim will now build and ship BOOT.CSV by itself.
  * debian/rules:
    - Update dh_auto_build/dh_auto_clean/dh_auto_install for new upstream
      options: set MAKELEVEL.
    - Define an EFI_ARCH variable, and use that for paths to shim. This
      makes it possible to build a shim for other architectures than amd64.
    - Set EFIDIR=ubuntu for dh_auto_install; that will let files be installed
      in the "right" final directories, and makes boot.csv for us.
    - Set ENABLE_SHIM_CERT, to keep using ephemeral self-signed certs built
      at compile-time for MokManager and fallback.
    - Set ENABLE_SBSIGN, to use sbsign instead of pesign for signing fallback
      and MokManager.
  * debian/patches/second-stage-path: dropped; the default loader path now
    includes an arch suffix.
  * debian/patches/sbsigntool-no-pesign: dropped; no longer needed..
  * debian/patches/0001-shim-fix-the-mirroring-MokSBState-fail.patch: dropped,
    included upstream.
  * debian/shim.install: update paths in light of using shim's upstream install
    target.
  * debian/rules, debian/shim.install: make sure the 'make install' step does
    what it's meant to do by upstream: we can easily make use of the end result
    to have the files we need.
